I still want my follow post to be their h-card. But I think I also want to include the url of the feeds I am following. Marking them up as u-url is wrong because its not about identity, but rel=feed wouldn't be restricted to the h-card. I think we might need a proposed mf2 h-card property that denotes a feed url of some sort","modes":["voice"]}
